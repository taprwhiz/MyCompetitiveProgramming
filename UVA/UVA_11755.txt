A cyclic DP problem 
	For knowledge, review 3 videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4yPThuiwBs&index=28&list=PLPt2dINI2MIattDutu7IOAMlUuLeN8k2p


Its main properties:
	1- Probability Domain (e.g. depth trick?)
	2- Direct cycling
	3- Small # of variables


Solutions

1) Arrange DP calls to drop the cycle, this is the most proper way

2) Don't know how to arrange, but it is probability
	After some depth, computed precision will be very low
	So code a cyclic reccurance, and use the depth trick
	Depth limit? Use the biggest possible according to your dp consumed memory

3) Small # of variables, just arrange the calls in a system of linear equations and solve
	Gaussian is ok
	Can we use upper triangle matrix processing?
