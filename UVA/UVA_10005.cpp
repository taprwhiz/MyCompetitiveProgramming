Mohamed Nabil:
By Proving that if a polygon can be  bounded by a circle then there is a way to bound the polygon by the circle
with one of the verticies on the circle and vice versa
And then proving if we can bound the polygon with 1 vertex on the circle then we can do it with 2 verticies on the circle
and vice versa
Solution:
Loop through all pairs of vertecies.. construct a circle that touches them both with radius R.. (There may be more than
one or non at all) and for each constructed circle check if all other points can be counded
