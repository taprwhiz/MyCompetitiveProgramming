Can be solved in 2 ways:

1) Dp solution for a vertex cover problem in a tree. See https://github.com/yelghareeb/problem_solving/blob/master/UVA/UVA_10859.cpp


2) A nice trick: For: minimizing a pair(a,b) is like minimizing a*x + b where x is the max difference possible between them. Using this trick, you can just do some DFS calls.
