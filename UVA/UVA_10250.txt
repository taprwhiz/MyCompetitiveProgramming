With a bit of math, you can prove that the four trees are the vertices of a square, and the two trees you're given are from opposite corners. So the problem is to find the other two corners.

I'm not the most elegant with geometry in general, but I think this method is pretty good.

Let (mx,my) be the midpoint of the line connecting (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).

Let dx = (mx-x1)
Let dy = (my-y1)

The other two corners are (mx-dy, my+dx) and (mx+dy, my-dx).
