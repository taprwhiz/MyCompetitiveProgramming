Well after dividing the first and second equation into two parts LHS and RHS we can observe that 
all of them have the same coefficient  (1 * X1 + 2 * X2 + 3 * X3 + 4 * X4) . 

This problem can be formulated now as follows : 
given any set of four numbers out of 16 numbers , how many sets of four numbers are exist such that 
having the same sum as the given set any set of four numbers also have 4! different sums 
	(as all the given numbers are distinct  ) 

So right now we can answer the following problem : 
given a set of 8 numbers , how many ways can we divide these 8 numbers into 
	two mutually exclusive sets of four numbers    

In order to solve the problem for two equations after solving the above problem   
The answer will be the summation of choosing any set of 8 numbers and multiply its 
	number of ways by number of ways of the other 8 numbers  
	
This step actually depends on your solution  you may traverse all the possible combination of 8 numbers
 out of 16 but in this case you'll have to divide your answer by two as you've computed 
 (A * B) & (B * A) or you can just visit each one of them once
