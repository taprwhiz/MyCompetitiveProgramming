Give fast readings about Great-circle distance
Which is about: Calculate distance, bearing and more between Latitude/Longitude points

Use the following function:

double sphericalDist(double p_lat, double p_long, double q_lat, double q_long)
{	// Assume lat & long in radians
	const double Radius = 6378.0;
	return acos( sin(p_lat)*sin(q_lat) +
                 cos(p_lat)*cos(q_lat) * cos(p_long - q_long) ) * Radius;
}
