DP
	First ignore the splitting part and assume that we only want to calculate the number of ways to create size k board. 
	The recurrence is: Ways(N) = 2 * Ways(N-1) + 2 * Ways(N-2); Of course we can calculate this using matrix exponentiation 
	but that is not the problem. The modulus is very small 10007. If we calculated the recurrence we can be sure that we will
	find cycle in the states in less than the modulus power 2 (because the recurrence depends only on the last two values and
    their values are less than the modulus so we have only modulus * modulus possible states). In fact the cycle length is 
    even shorter (10006). So Ways(N) depends solely on N mod 10006. That means that
    Ways(k) * Ways(N-k) equal Ways(k+10006) * Ways(N-k-10006) (for k <= N-10006). 
	Using this, we can calculate the answer only to k in range 0..10006 and multiply times 
    the number we will repeat this cycle (i.e. "(N+1)/10006") and then add the rest of the numbers 
    outside these cycles (i.e. k in range floor((N+1)/10006) * 10006..N).
