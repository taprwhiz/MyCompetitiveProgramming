A. Count the Graphs: Hussain Kara Fallah		Div1-E DP
B. Game of Nim Everywhere: Noureldin Yosri		Medium		obseration/DP/combinatorics
C. FIFA World Cup: Noureldin Yosri				Medium		Greedy
D. Crazy LCP: Badry Atef						
E. This Means War: Noureldin Yosri				Div2-E		Dynamic convex hull, DP
F. The Walking Adam: Ahmed Aly					ACE
G. Darts Game: Ahmed Aly						Div2-E		Circle Sweep algorithm / Easy idea / tough impl
H. Stock Exchange: Islam Al-Aarag				Medium		Greedy	Needs validator for floats
I. Winter is Here: Badry Atef					Div1-D		dsu on trees + segment trees (Reasonable idea / Impl is the hard part)
J. Array Queries: Hussain Kara Fallah			Div2-E 		Segment Tree (teams don't try, though doable)
K. Duplicate Files: Ahmed Aly					ACE
=============
- K/F: 2 ACE (So Easy/impl) problems
- H/B/C: Medium problems. H/C are greedy and B needed some obseration to reduce to DP/combinatorics. Level opinions vary from Div2-C to Div2-D
- D: needed Trie + Mo (or segment tree). Its level is like Div2-E problem. Opinion: Something wrong for this problem from judges side as many solutions should be TLEd.
Hard Problems (Div2-E level)
- J: segment tree with few observations. Weird that many teams did not solve. Not that hard.
- E: Dynamic convex hull, DP
- G: Circle Sweep algorithm. (Reasonable idea / Impl is the hard part)
Very Hard Problems
- I: (Div1-D) dsu on trees + segment trees (Reasonable idea / Impl is the hard part)
- A: (Div1-E) DP

General notes:
- Common reported issue after the easiest 5 problems: "difficulty curve was not smooth; a lot of teams solved the same number of problems and were only differentiated by penalty, even in the top spots"
- Overall level, like ECPC, is harder than last ACPC.
- J solved by Ossama team. 
- A/G not solved by any teams. Many tried in G but with several wrong answers
- Good Quality / Interesting problems
- A is really the challenging idea problem, but others are more of reduce to problem / hard impl / handle cases
