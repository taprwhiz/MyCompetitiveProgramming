Let's consider each team separately. For a team to qualify, the number of other
teams with strictly higher score must be at most one, otherwise that team will
not have a score equal to one of the teams in the top two positions.

We first see which matches are remaining in the last round. This can be easily
done using a 2D boolean array. We make the team we're considering win his game,
and for other games we calculate the outcome of all three possible scenarios
(win, lose, and draw), and pick the outcome that minimises the number of teams
in that game ending with strictly higher score. If the total number of such
teams exceeds one, the current team cannot qualify.
