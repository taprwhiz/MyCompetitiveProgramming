Mohamed Emad Emsawy we can imagine any four points like two triangles :

First shape:
Triangle (p0,p1,p2) is parallel with (p0,p1,p3) and the distance between the points (p2,p3) is the minimum distance we can get if they are parallel ( angle between the them is 0).

Second shape:
Triangle (p0,p1,p2) is opposite to (p0,p1,p3) and the distance between the points (p2,p3) is the maximum distance we can get if they are opposite (angle between them is 180).

if we get maximum and minimum distance which the two triangle can make , then w can compare the given distance (X) between points (p2,p3) with the minimum and maximum distance.
if the min <= X and max >= X ,then it is a valid four points.

We can get the coordinates of points (p2,p3) using polar system.
