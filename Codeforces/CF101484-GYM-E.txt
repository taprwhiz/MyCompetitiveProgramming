		implementation of the above solution but super faster and exponentially less code

		Nasser: basically we need to check if one of the polygons is the convex hull of both ( while processing colinear points in the hull), 
			Another way to do it is point in convex polygon in log(n) but I got many WA's..either I can't implement it correctly or missing some case <.<
